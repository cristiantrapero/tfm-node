# Una soluciÃ³n basada en LoRa para comunicaciones multimedia en entornos extremos

The main objective of this work will be to develop a communications system that allows multimedia traffic of any size to be sent over long distances using the **LoRa RAW** (pure LoRa, no LoRaWAN) channel.

This is implemented for the __Pycom LoPy 4__. The LoPy setups a BLE server to be able to connect to an Android application to manage the sending of multimedia files and once receive, it is forwarded to another LoPy 4.

# How to setup the application
1. Install **NojeJS** depending on the operating system you have using https://nodejs.org/es/download/ or with NVM https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
2. Install the **Pymakr tool** for Atom as described here: https://docs.pycom.io/gettingstarted/software/atom/
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/cristiantrapero/tfm-node.git`
4. Open this project in Atom
5. Connect the LoPy 4 to the computer USB
6. List the serial ports with the Pymakr bar: `All commands -> Pymakr -> Extra -> List Serial Ports`
7. Change the `"address": "COM5"` in the pymakr.conf file to your corresponding setial port listed
8. Run the Pymakr command: `Upload`
9. Wait until load the project in the LoPy 4
10. Open the `node.py` file in the Atom editor and select `Run` in the Pymakr bar.
11. Connect the Android application to the sender node and take the image and send it. The application is located in: https://github.com/cristiantrapero/tfm-android

# Files
The repository is structured as follow:

- `src`: Contains the source code of the project concerning the implementation of the sender and receiver.
  - boot.py: Disables WiFi to avoid interferences
  - node.py: Main function. Setup BLE, LoRa and all necessary.
- `lib`: LoRaCTP protocol library.
  - loractp.py: Contains the Lora Content Transfer Protocol (loractp) with his API.
- `pymakr.conf`: Pymakr configuration file. **Is necessary change `"address": "COM5"` setting**.
